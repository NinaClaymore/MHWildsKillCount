Hi everyone, I'm Nina Claymore, besides being a streamer I also like to do coding.
I hope this can help my friends who are fellow streamers to count how many monsters have been killed and display them into the stream.

I will continue to update this project regularly if there are additional monsters or bugs in the coding that I do.

You can also visit me if you want to get acquainted or thank me for making this killing count, hopefully you can continue to stream and get a lot of viewers, cheers!!!
